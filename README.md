## Project Overview

This platform will offer a **step-by-step tutorial system** with **interactive demos** for computer vision techniques, such as image classification, segmentation, object detection, and more. Users will be able to engage with **live examples** to experiment and learn in a practical manner.

The platform is designed to support learners from **beginner** to **advanced** levels and will offer content on topics ranging from basic image transformations to cutting-edge machine learning applications.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Tutorials**: Learn by doing. Follow tutorials and experiment with computer vision techniques in real-time.
- **Live Demos**: Real-time, interactive computer vision demos (e.g., edge detection, object classification).
- **Beginner to Advanced Paths**: Tutorials designed to cater to different levels of expertise, from beginner to expert.
- **User Accounts**: Create accounts to track progress and participate in challenges.
- **Gamification**: Earn badges and achievements by completing milestones in tutorials.

---

## Tech Stack

The following technologies will be used in the project:

- **Frontend**:  
  - **React** for building interactive user interfaces.
  - **TailwindCSS** for styling.
  - **Three.js** (optional) for 3D visualization (if relevant).

- **Backend**:  
  - **FastAPI** for fast, asynchronous server-side operations.
  - **PostgreSQL** for database management.
  - **OAuth2** for user authentication.

- **Computer Vision**:  
  - **OpenCV** for image processing.
  - **PyTorch** for machine learning models and deep learning.
  - **Flask** (optional) for deploying specific models as APIs.

- **Deployment**:  
  - **Docker** for containerization.
  - **Heroku/AWS** for deployment.
